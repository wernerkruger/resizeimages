# resizeimages
Batch resize images using python to achieve a specific filesize

As a photographer, many sites require me to upload images that does not exceed a certain size (1Mb typically). The (free) resize tools that I have seen enables you to resize accorsing to widht and height, but doesn't really optimize towards a specific filesize. So I took 10 minutes to create this little script.
